I think that a systematic review could however massively help to stop/reduce unnecessary animal testing, for example you might find the experiment you want to do has been done before etc...

But if you have an entirely or mostly novel experiment in mind then I think you probably have to do the test as animal experiments are still necessary to generate new data that no-one has yet.

The easier it becomes to do systematic reviews the more people will use them too, but first the papers have to include clear data and be written in a way that enables the systematic reviews to be performed well, e.g. with a clear methods section, no missing data etc...
